# Linux, Shell, and C Lab

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the Ubuntu Linux, shell scripting, and C programming lab.

## Structure
- `command-line/`: Logs from command-line tasks.
- `shell-scripts/`: Shell scripts for automation.
- `c-programs/`: C programs with compilation.

## Testing and Running
**Command Line:** Used `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, etc., and verified logs like `easy-log.txt`.  
**Shell Scripts:** Tested `easy-greet.sh` with input; `file-count.sh` with directories.  
**C Programs:** Compiled with `gcc`. Ran `contacts.c` to manage contacts.  
**Project:** `project.sh` compiles and runs `contacts.c`, creates a backup of `c-programs/`, and appends to `project-log.txt`.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Learned Git commits and debugging C with `gdb`.
- Challenges: File permissions and pointer syntax.
