# Linux, Shell, and C Lab

## Overview
This repository contains my work for Linux command-line basics, shell scripting, C programming, and an integration project.

## Structure
- `command-line/` – Logs from command-line tasks (e.g., `easy-log.txt`, `intermediate-log.txt`).
- `shell-scripts/` – Shell scripts for automation (e.g., `easy-greet.sh`, `file-check.sh`, `file-count.sh`, `project.sh`).
- `c-programs/` – C programs compiled with `gcc` (e.g., `easy-c.c`, `add.c`, `factorial.c`, `contacts.c`).

## Testing and Running
- **Command Line:** Tested commands (`ls`, `cd`, `nano`, etc.) and verified logs (`easy-log.txt`, `intermediate-log.txt`).
- **Shell Scripts:** Ran `easy-greet.sh` (input + date), `file-check.sh` (file existence), `file-count.sh` (counts by type).
- **C Programs:** Compiled and tested `add.c` (sum of 2 numbers), `factorial.c` (recursive factorial), and `contacts.c`.
- **Project:** Ran `project.sh` which compiled `contacts.c`, executed it, backed up `c-programs/`, and logged results to `project-log.txt`.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Fixed script permission errors using `chmod +x`.
- Debugged C segmentation faults with `gdb`.
- Learned Git commits, branching, and pull requests.
